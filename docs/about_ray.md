### What this is.
* I came to good coding habits and healthy developing methods step by step, learning from examples around me. Please tolerate my naive codes years ago.
* They are not all perfect, but they sure show the learning curve, and hope it can bring a sense of authenticity.

### AI/ Machine Learning/ Deep Learning
* Kaggle competitions:
    * I go by username raynardj, sometime I change name, sometime I join team, but always the Robert D Jr avatar.learning
