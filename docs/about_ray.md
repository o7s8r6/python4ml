# About Ray
# 关于张晓晨

### What this is.
* I came to good coding habits and healthy developing methods step by step, learning from examples around me. Please tolerate my naive codes years ago.
* They are not all perfect, but they sure show the learning curve, and hope it can bring a sense of authenticity.
* Some notebook has heavy Latex comments, and won't render on github page. It has to be opened in jupyter notebook to work properly.

### AI/ Machine Learning/ Deep Learning
* Kaggle competitions:
    * I go by username raynardj, sometime I change name, sometime I join team, but always the Robert D Jr avatar.learning
    * [Recursion Cellular Image Classification](https://www.kaggle.com/c/recursion-cellular-image-classification), bronze medal, public leaderboard [(88/866)](https://www.kaggle.com/c/recursion-cellular-image-classification/leaderboard), competition summary and codes [here](https://github.com/raynardj/python4ml/tree/master/experiments/rcic)

* Machine Learning Related Repos
    * [ForgeBox](https://github.com/raynardj/forge/tree/master/forgebox), my personal machine learning/ deep learning tool box. pip installable.
    * [Forge](https://github.com/raynardj/forge), a web framework we can use to track AI experiments, in code and on UI frondend.
    * My experiments on [object detection, yolov3 with DenseNet backbone](https://github.com/raynardj/obj_detection)
    * [Sequence to sequence from scratch](https://github.com/raynardj/seqtwoseq)
    * A universal [PyTorch API docker](https://github.com/raynardj/pytorch_api)

* None-AI personal projects
I'm not looking for this line of job, the following are just showcase of engineering proficiency
    * [Read sense](http://www.rasenn.com/), an online english literature library I built up in 3 days. Simple CRUD on book, author, user and permissions. Hooked up to google reCAPTCHA. [git repository here](https://github.com/raynardj/readsense)
    * [A wedding management tool](https://github.com/raynardj/wedding) for my own wedding. Able to manage guests/tables, and randomly check our photos with our own love quotes.
